description: "Oil painting that belongs to the series \"insegurança pública\". In this work I used as a reference a media photographic record that denounced the violence of the 1964 military dictatorship against a white young woman, I chose to do a reinterpretation replacing the victim with a black woman in order to give visibility to black people who were also victims of violence of the dictatorship despite not making the headlines of the time.<br>
<br>
The objective of this series is to reflect on the images of violence as mechanisms of oppression and resistance during the period of the Brazilian military dictatorship, considering the aspects of race, class and gender. In addition, I wanted to discuss similarities and differences of urban violence between the dictatorial period and the present day.
