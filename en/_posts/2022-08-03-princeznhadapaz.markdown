In addition to individual works, she participates in collective actions with platforms in Belo Horizonte, such as GALLA ON FIRE, a trans-Travestigenre and dissident artistic articulation that strategically occupies the arts systems, to make visible and value artistic works by trans and black people."

— Don't talk to me like you're my tamer!<br>
— With skill, and may today be different from when your little brat ways got into me.<br>
— We go according to one’s personality, one obeys when one wants, when it is convenient for thyself or when one is being subjugated...<br>
