description: "The concept of the work is to simultaneously demonstrate something elementary and dubious referenced in a children's game. In it I bring two personas in which one is supported by the strength of the other. Their physical characteristics can be understood as the social pyramid that is composed of a broad base, but limited in resources – that's why the blue persona is smaller and thinner. The reddish persona is larger, despite being equally thin, which can demonstrate that both the base and the top of the pyramid are lacking something that truly nourishes them.

<br><br>
The reddish persona has a slingshot, which demonstrates that the top pyramid is equipped with a weapon while being supported by the base, which even with its limitation and resource disadvantage supports the top. The main question is the fact that both personas are blindfolded, they have weapons, target, but no vision, which makes the fight against a true enemy more complex.
<br><br>
Its colors can relate to the current moment of political polarization in our country, in which we are in the same place, but divided. And without vision, we can't look down to see the needs below our belly button, and we can't look up to see the bigger picture.
<br><br>
The scenery is an already worn and outdated wooden fence, which hinders the visualization of a perceptible blue sky through the holes and grooves. This scenario can be interpreted as the fence being the old policy, which still surrounds us despite the fact that we can already see small holes that lead us to a more expansive view of the world.
