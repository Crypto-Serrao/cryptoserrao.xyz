# OBRA
title: Cafuza
category: Music

description: "Cafuza appears as a proposal to create a musical theme for the opening of the podcast Pelo Avesso. The instrumental composition develops a rhythm with musical elements that refer to indigenous and Afro-Brazilian sounds in a plot with guitars and electronic textures. The music carries a feeling of affirmation of a Brazilianness that is raised by the strength, beauty, resistance and charms of native peoples and black communities. A Brazil that disputes the present, re-reads the past and visualizes its future in the arms, minds and souls of black and indigenous people.
<br><br>
The podcast Pelo Avesso addressed the theme of eugenics and the harmful consequences of this racist theory in the structures, in the imagination and in the actions of the Brazilian state and society. Although the song is featured on the Pelo Avesso podcast, it was never released.
