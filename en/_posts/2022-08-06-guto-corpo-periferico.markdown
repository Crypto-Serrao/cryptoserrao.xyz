artist-bio: "Hey, my name is Gustavo Martins, but you can call me Guto! I'm 28 years old and I'm from Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais. I started painting in 2016 in order to illustrate my first blog \"Um ex adolescent\", in which I published poems, short stories, chronicles, with watercolor paintings. Through art, I seek to narrate experiences as a black, gay and peripheral boy. Alto Vera Cruz, the neighborhood in which I grew up, has a strong influence on these experiences."

description: "The Modern Art Week was held after 100 years of Brazil's Independence, and sought to create an image of what it means to be Brazilian. However, during the previous years, newly \"freed\" enslaved peoples were left to self-survival.
<br><br>
At the time of the artistic movement, poor workers, mostly non-white, were expelled from their homes in central regions. Like the story of the Papuda woman who lived in what is now the Palácio da Liberdade (Belo Horizonte). The destruction of Curral Del Rey forced the original residents to leave their homes, expelling them from the Central region to the outskirts of the city.
<br><br>
While there was a growth of the suburban population, one of the real realities of the Brazilian person, there was a strengthening of those who hold money and power through the work of these people.
<br><br>
Within communities, one of the bodies that most suffer from the impacts of globalization is that of the mother – especially single mothers; who face financial risks and difficulties such as overload, and maintain a greater backlog of tasks.
<br><br>
This watercolor painting is inspired by the Venus sculpture by Willendorf and idealizes the black mother, a representation of fertility, the same one who stands on the front line of the Brazilian suburbs. The overlapping of the limbs denote how this body is divided to take care of the numerous duties that fall on this being. This is one of the true Brazilians."
