# OBRA
title: Cabeças abertas
nft-link: https://teia.art/objkt/770310
img: rafael-boneco.jpg
category: Pintura
description: "Cabeças abertas is a proposition/work under construction that takes place primarily around the city and the walls of Belo Horizonte, written with spray and latex paint, which deals with time and how information or knowledge fills us in some way. Especially for Crypto/Serrão, a watercolor on paper was developed, portraying in an unprecedented way a composition of disembodied heads piling up and strangely balanced. Just like the artist does on the streets."
