She has the joy of living and a certain rebelliousness as her main motivations for creating. Through art she can create rescues and escapes from a dystopian reality and at the same time denounce it.

description: "The magic of opposites consists in never being able to put them together, like water and oil, but in understanding that there will be no meaning if they are seen alone. For the contrast to exist, there must be opposites together, and then water and wine will prove to be the most inseparable couple among the living.<br>
<br>
The contrast between the rhinoceros and the woman occurs when thinking of the animal as the personification of power and the female figure as glory, royalty, and vice versa. In this way, they express an unconditional and inseparable couple, making sense only under the condition of being together.<br>
