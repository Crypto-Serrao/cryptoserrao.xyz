# ARTISTA
artist: zezito
artist-img: zezito - José Victor Mendes Dias.jpg
artist-bio: "I'm José Victor, aka zezito. I am 19 years old, I was born and raised in the east side of Belo Horizonte. My contact with art began with illustration and then I went through painting, photography, audiovisual production, among many other forms of expression and representation.<br>
<br>
Art occupies a very important place in my life, pushing me at all times. Through it I try to represent a little bit of what I live and see, being a young black man, from a suburb, and being part of the LGBTQ+ community.<br>
<br>
Currently, I have ventured into the development of digital paintings, exploring and learning a lot in this infinite world of possibilities.

<br>
Excerpt from the song Ismália, by Emicida, which has been perpetuated in my mind since 2019, when I produced this work. As time passes, since its conception, the more sense it seems to make.<br>
<br>
A reflection on the fragility of conquests and disproportionate demand directed at a people. In a society where error is decisive and in order to be, it is necessary to be twice as much.
