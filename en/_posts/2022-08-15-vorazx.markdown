description: "This trap song was made because I almost lost my motorbike last year due to a ride with the wrong companies... In 2022, entering the rap scene, I had this idea. And I also wanted to portray a little of our experience, a little of what we like. I wanted to encourage those who listen to 160 to always seek the path of prosperity, without getting their arses busted."
