description: "The concept of the work is to simultaneously demonstrate something elementary and dubious referenced in a children's game. In it I bring two personas in which one is sustained by the force of the other, their physical characteristics can be understood as the social pyramid that is composed of a wide base, but limited in resources and therefore the blue persona is smaller and more frail.
<br><br>
The red persona is larger, although equally frail, which may demonstrate that both the base and the top of the pyramid are insufficient in something that really nourishes them. The red persona has a slingshot, which demonstrates that the top of the pyramid is armed while being sustained by the base, which even with its limitation and disadvantage of resources sustains the top. The main question is given to the fact that both personas are blindfolded, they have the weapon, the target, but they do not have the vision, which makes the fight against the true enemy more complex.
<br><br>
Their colors can be related to the current moment of political polarization of our country in which we are in the same place, but divided. And without vision, we cannot look down to see the needs below our navel, nor look up to have a broader vision.
<br><br>
The scenario is a fence of already worn and outdated wood, which hinders the visualization of a perceptible blue sky through the holes and grooves. This scenario can be interpreted by the fence being the old politics, which still surrounds us even though we can already see small holes that lead us to a more expansive view of the world.
