description: "Espírito Livre (free spirit) is a small EP composed of 3 experimental lo-fi/chillhop beats. A work entirely faithful to the culture of sampling, with calm timbres, such as rhodes and sax, which contrast with striking boombap drums.
<br><br>
Free is what I seek to be, in and out of my songs. I seek to express in an abstract way everything my heart feels and all the experience I already carry in this existence. At the same time, I seek to provide a feeling of refuge and tranquility with the choice of timbres, thus contributing to finding an internal freedom whenever the sound is playing.
<br><br>
The track names are respectively:
<br><br>
1. Suspiro (0:00)<br>
2. Fuga (2:47)<br>
3. Alívio (4:46)"
