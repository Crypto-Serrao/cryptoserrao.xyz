description: "This photo I took trying out a film that was expired, aiming for an overexposure. The result was very grainy and unclear photos. I like this series because it reminds me a lot of the old photos we have here in the shanty town. It takes me to a time when access was very rare, being able to reproduce this aesthetic even in an experimental way today is nothing less than a privilege. I really like this almost contradictory idea of ​​bringing analog to the apex of what we have of access and consumption of digital images and arts in general, an analog NFT... Is it possible? I think so!
<br/><br/>
Starting from the motto proposed by Crypto/Serrão, Modernism, I think that this proposal dialogues a lot with the idea or proposal of modernizing the analog, even if it is just a simulacrum formed by “zeros” and “ones”. Whenever I think about it, Chico Science's monologue comes to my mind:
<br/><br/>
modernize the past<br/>
It's a musical evolution<br/>
Where are the notes that were here?<br/>
I don't need them!<br/>
Just let it all sound good to the ears<br/>
<br/>
This tells me that no matter how hard I try to reproduce the past, it will only be an attempt. Just do it the best way I can, and get as close to my initial goal as possible.
