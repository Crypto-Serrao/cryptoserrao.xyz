LC's MC Vitin has a funk called Tatuagem da Aranha (Spider's Tattoo), where he tells the story of a young man from a favela enjoying his weekend. The spider tattoo appears as a symbol of communication. I live in the Concórdia neighborhood, which was born from the eviction of a favela that is now called Barro Preto, in Belo Horizonte. Here in the neighborhood, several children get a haircut that consists of the traditional “disguised” haircut with a spider drawn on the back of the head. This cut reaffirms the spider as an element of communication between young people from peripheral territories. The painting Corte da Aranha tries to account for this poetic dimension.
